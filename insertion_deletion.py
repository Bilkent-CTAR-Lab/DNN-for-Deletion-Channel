def ins_del_channel(c, Pd, Pi, Ps):
    """
    Simulate an insertion/deletion/substition channel and generate received signal 
    based on the transmitted codeword.

    Parameters:
    - c (numpy.ndarray): The transmitted codeword through the channel.
    - Pd (float): Probability of deletion event in the channel.
    - Pi (float): Probability of insertion event in the channel.
    - Ps (float): Probability of substitution event in the channel.

    Returns:
    - y (list): The received signal after passing through the insertion-deletion channel.
    - trans (numpy.ndarray): An array indicating the type of operation (correct transmission, deletion, or insertion) 
    for each symbol in the codeword.

    Channel Model:
    The insertion-deletion channel operates as follows:
    - Each symbol in the transmitted codeword undergoes one of three operations: 
        1) correct transmission, 2) deletion, or 3) insertion.
    - The probabilities of these operations are defined by Pd (deletion), Pi (insertion),
         and the remaining probability Pt (correct transmission) = 1- Pd - Pi.
    - For correct transmission ('c'), the transmitted bit may be flipped with probability Ps (substitution).
    - For insertion ('i'), two random bits (with i.i.d uniform probability) are inserted into the received signal.
    - For deletion ('d'), the symbol is simply deleted from the received signal.

    Example:
    >>> c = np.array([[0, 1, 0, 1]])
    >>> Pd = 0.1
    >>> Pi = 0.2
    >>> Ps = 0.0
